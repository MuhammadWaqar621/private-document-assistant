"""
Thin wrapper around the Groq API used for speech-to-text (Whisper),
text-to-speech (PlayAI TTS), and - when selected via LLM_PROVIDER (see
app/engine/llm_provider.py) - chat completions.

Configuration is read directly from environment variables (not from
app.core.config.Settings) so that app/engine/ has zero dependency on the
rest of the FastAPI application - see app/engine/__init__.py for the full
isolation contract and app/engine/azure_client.py's module docstring for
the same reasoning applied to Azure OpenAI. In practice these values still
originate from the same .env file (docker-compose's `env_file: .env`
exports them as real process environment variables for the backend
container).

Groq exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so the `openai` package (already a
dependency, used for Azure OpenAI elsewhere in this engine) is reused here
too, just pointed at Groq's base URL - no separate SDK is needed.

Env vars:
  - GROQ_API_KEY: required for anything in this module to work.
  - GROQ_STT_MODEL: Whisper model for transcribe_audio(). Default below.
  - GROQ_TTS_MODEL / GROQ_TTS_VOICE: model/voice for synthesize_speech().
    Defaults below.
  - GROQ_LLM_MODEL: chat-completion model used when LLM_PROVIDER="groq"
    (the default - see app/engine/llm_provider.py). Default below.
